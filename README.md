# odin-recipes
First website built out in a while. 
Things done:
- wrote the html template out
- used headers
- used ordered and unordered lists
- linked pages together, as well as an external one
- added images and changed the size (didn't add the description though, supposed to be good for seo)
- used strong and em
- added, commited and pushed to git ; still unclear why we need to add to commit.
